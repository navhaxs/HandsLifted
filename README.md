## Dev set up

I have been testing using 'Syncfusion File Formats' library to import PPTX files on systems that do not have Microsoft PowerPoint installed, or non-Windows platforms.
(This process works by using the Syncfusion library to convert the PPTX to PDF, then using PDFiumCore/Ghostscript to convert the PDF to a set of PNG images).

To use this feature, please set an ENV variable `SyncfusionLicenseKey=<your license key>`. You can obtain a license key for free via registering at Syncfusion. They also offer a free license for open-source projects.
